## Description

Each time you start the game, numbers are generated randomly on the board.

The numbers are hidden in the corresponding color on the board, and if number cannot be found during some time, then it is highlighted.

Our task is to find a way out of the maze, it will always be at the end of the maze (on the right side of the screen), but where exactly - we do not know, since the exit point from the labyrinth is randomly generated each time. If we find a way out of the maze we will see the inscription that you win.

If the slider has timed out, then the inscription appears on the screen that the game is lost.
