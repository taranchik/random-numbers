## Description

Each time you start the game, a maze will be generated as new, different from the old.

In the upper left point of the screen you can see a slider that provides information on how much time is left before the end of the game. The game lasts 2 minutes and 30 seconds

Our task is to find a way out of the maze, it will always be at the end of the maze (on the right side of the screen), but where exactly - we do not know, since the exit point from the labyrinth is randomly generated each time. If we find a way out of the maze we will see the inscription that you win.

If the slider has timed out, then the inscription appears on the screen that the game is lost.
